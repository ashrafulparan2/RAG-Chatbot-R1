I'm getting a bit overwhelmed with the number of messages I'm receiving. take a step back and think about what I need help with. what is rnn A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is a type of artificial neural network (ANN) designed to recognize patterns in sequences of data, such as text, genomes, or time series. Unlike feedforward neural networks, which process data in a single pass, RNNs have loops that allow information to flow between their neurons, enabling them to maintain context and dependencies between sequential data points. In the context of machine learning and natural language processing, RNNs are particularly useful for tasks that involve sequential data, such as language modeling, text generation, translation, and summarization. They work by processing each element of the input sequence one at a time, updating their internal state (or memory) at each step. This allows them to maintain a sort of \"memory\" of previous inputs, which can be crucial for tasks like language modeling where the context from previous words is important. The PDF I referred to earlier provides more details on RNNs, mentioning their application in various tasks. For example,.",
