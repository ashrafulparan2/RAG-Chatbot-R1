Machine Learning Fundamentals

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.

Types of Machine Learning:

1. Supervised Learning
   - Uses labeled training data
   - Examples: Classification, Regression
   - Algorithms: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, SVM, Neural Networks

2. Unsupervised Learning
   - Uses unlabeled data to find hidden patterns
   - Examples: Clustering, Association Rules
   - Algorithms: K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, PCA

3. Reinforcement Learning
   - Learning through interaction with environment
   - Reward-based learning system
   - Examples: Game AI, Robotics, Trading algorithms

Common Machine Learning Applications:
- Image recognition and computer vision
- Natural language processing
- Recommendation systems
- Fraud detection
- Predictive analytics
- Medical diagnosis
- Autonomous vehicles
- Speech recognition

Popular Machine Learning Libraries:
- scikit-learn (Python)
- TensorFlow (Google)
- PyTorch (Facebook)
- Keras (High-level neural networks)
- Pandas (Data manipulation)
- NumPy (Numerical computing)
